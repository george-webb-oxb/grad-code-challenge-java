// Graduate Coding Challenge - Java

// Here are a series of small coding challeneges in cpp for you to try!
// There is no right or wrong answer, just give it a go!

// Don't worry about not finishing it.
// Don't google a solution to the questions!
// You can search for small things like "what does this function return".

// Leave all the code you write, even the debug stuff :)!
// Just comment it out if you need to run the app.

// Each question has a URL to an explanation of what we are asking :)

// Replit -> You can edit what happens when you hit run in the .replit file

// Have fun!

class Main {
  // 1. Write a function that takes in an array of unordered numbers
  //    (data.java) and returns an array of ordered numbers 
  //    (ascending order) using a merge sort. 
  //    Don't use an sort function from java (that makes it too easy)
  // Merge Sort: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjdkw6f/revision/5

  // 2. Write a function to show your sorting works on your ordered numbers
  //    (e.g. Prints "Passed" to the terminal on an expected result).

  // 3. Write a function that performs a binary search to return 
  //    the index of a given number (if it exists!).
  // Binary Search: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zjdkw6f/revision/3
  // (Try not to read the pseudocode at the end of the page....)

  // 4. Write a function to show your binary search works 
  //    (e.g. Prints "Passed" to the terminal on an expected result).

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
  }
}
